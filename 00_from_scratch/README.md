This aims to scaffold a debugging report for 05/05/2025's ob demo.

It currently has very conservative hotfixes, including [a recipe to install ob main](01_install_main_ob.sh) and a recipe to install [a derivative of ob dev](02_install_dev_ob.sh).

These patches are also partly being tested (automation) at https://github.com/omnibenchmark/clustering_example/tree/imallona-patch-1

Main comments about the debugging status can be checked at https://github.com/omnibenchmark/omnibenchmark/pull/110
