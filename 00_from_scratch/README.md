This aims to scaffold a debugging report for 05/05/2025's ob demo.

It currently has very conservative hotfixes, including [a recipe to install ob main](01_install_main_ob.sh) and a recipe to install [a derivative of ob dev](02_install_dev_ob.sh).

These patches are also partly being tested (automation) at https://github.com/omnibenchmark/clustering_example/tree/imallona-patch-1

Main comments about the debugging from Izaskun's perspective can be checked at imallona's [dev hotfix](https://github.com/omnibenchmark/omnibenchmark/pull/110).

We're preparing [a postmortem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZIYzAgNKAhu3xCnmuiJA45iOx36ChP44Hk9ISvrWsXc/edit?usp=sharing) but this repo is a quick fix/debug process on its own and the whole team will release a more robust hotfix than [dev hotfix](https://github.com/omnibenchmark/omnibenchmark/pull/110). Still, [dev hotfix](https://github.com/omnibenchmark/omnibenchmark/pull/110) works already.
